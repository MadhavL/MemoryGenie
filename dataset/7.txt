Gardening has become my new obsession.

Really? I never pegged you as a plant person.

It's surprisingly therapeutic. I have this mini herb garden on my balcony.

That's cool. Fresh herbs make such a difference in cooking.

Exactly! I'm thinking of expanding to some flowers too. Any recommendations?

Lavender is easy to care for, and it smells amazing.

Good call. I could use some natural fragrance around here.

Gardening is addictive, though. Don't say I didn't warn you.

I'm ready for the challenge!
