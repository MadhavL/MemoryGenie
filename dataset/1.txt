So, any exciting plans for the weekend?

Not really, just thinking of catching up on some reading. How about you?

Oh, I'm heading to a concert on Saturday. It's this indie band I've been wanting to see for ages.

That sounds awesome! Which band is it?

They're called "Whispering Pines." You should check them out sometime.

I'll do that. Anything else happening?

Sunday, I might go for a hike. Need some nature therapy, you know?

Totally get that. I might binge-watch a new series. Any recommendations?

Oh, "Mystic Haven" on that streaming service. It's a mind-bender.

Cool, I'll add it to my list. Well, enjoy your weekend!

You too!
