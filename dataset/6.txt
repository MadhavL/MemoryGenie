I just finished this amazing book.

Oh, what's it called?

"The Silent Symphony." It's a mystery novel with a surprising twist at the end.

Sounds intriguing. I need a good book to dive into. Any other recommendations?

If you like non-fiction, "Sapiens" is a mind-blowing exploration of human history.

I've heard about it. I'll give it a shot. Do you prefer physical books or e-books?

I love the feel of a physical book, but lately, I've been into e-books for the convenience.

Same here. Can't beat the portability.

Totally. Let me know what you think of "Sapiens" when you finish it.

Will do.
