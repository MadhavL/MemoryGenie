Remember those games we used to play as kids?

Oh, for sure! Hide and seek was my favorite.

Mine too! The thrill of hiding and trying not to giggle was priceless.

And playing tag until we were out of breath. Good times.

Do kids even play those games nowadays, or is it all video games?

It's different now. Everything's so digital. But those outdoor games were special.

True. We were more connected to each other, don't you think?

Absolutely. We should organize a throwback game day sometime.

That's a fantastic idea! Let's make it happen.
