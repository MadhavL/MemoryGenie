Looking through old photos always makes me want to travel.

Tell me about it. Any favorite travel memory?

The trip to Italy was unforgettable. The art, the architecture, and, of course, the pasta.

Italy is on my bucket list. Did you explore any hidden gems?

Cinque Terre was a dream. Those colorful cliffside villages are straight out of a postcard.

Wow, sounds amazing.
